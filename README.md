A simple text blog engine written with Node.js, Express and React.

See a working demo [here](https://s8rvo.csb.app).

### Why and How?

This project was build just because I wanted to brush up on some Node.js and React concepts. 

React Hooks have been used in a lot of components, and class Components have been used when required or more convenient.

Coding is about being comfortable as well as not spoiling efficienty at the same time.

The Blog Engine just supports plain text input, which will most likely be changed in the future. So No Worries. 

At the same time, if you were looking for a blog engine with fully featured font formatter and file uploader, then this one isn't for you, at least for right now. Instead, opt for a PHP Based Blog Engine like WordPress.

### Okay, so how do I get started.

I am not really good at documentations, but you can look at my best attempts at it in the respective folders for the Frontend and the Backend. 

They have got instructions on how to set the stuff up.

### I have a problem, how do I contact?

Just raise an issue in the repo, or [mail me](mailto:devesh2027@gmail.com).
